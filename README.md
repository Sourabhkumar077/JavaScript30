## Introduction
This challenge is designed to improve my JavaScript skills by building a variety of projects. Each day, I will create a new project that showcases different aspects of JavaScript and web development.

## Projects

   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash

   ```
3. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.
